# note-taker-2.0

## Description
This week challenge was to build a note taker app using express.js. The idea of the app is to link the html page to a backend server that will store all the notes you save in json format. The app relies on the GET, POST methods. I was a little confused at first because coming from the module 11 project 'Zookeeper', they had given us an array already that had data in it. the challenge did not so I was a little thrown off by that but I managed to figure it out.
